# Redux and its concepts

## Redux

Redux is a state management library commonly used with React applications, although it can be integrated with other JavaScript frameworks as well. It helps manage the state of an application in a predictable way, making it easier to develop and maintain large-scale applications.

## Important Concepts

1. Store: A single, centralized state container that holds the entire state tree of the application. The state is read-only, and the only way to modify it is by dispatching actions.

2. Action: Plain JavaScript objects that represent events or user interactions. Actions are dispatched to the store to trigger state changes.

3. Reducer: Pure functions that specify how the state changes in response to an action. Reducers take the current state and an action as arguments, and they return a new state based on these inputs.

4. Dispatch: The process of sending an action to the store. It is the only way to trigger a state change.

5. Subscribe: A function that allows components to listen for changes in the state. When the state in the store changes, subscribers are notified, and they can update their views accordingly.
